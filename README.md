# MeloZone
Our project involves creating a desktop application for streaming music. The main goal of the application is to allow logged-in users to play music in real-time, which we will obtain from open sources. The application will allow users to browse and listen to albums and artist profiles. We will implement the ability to pause, resume, and skip tracks.

For the design, we will use the Spring framework and the Firebase database. Optional functionalities include creating and playing playlists, playback history, adding favorite songs, and user interface personalization.
